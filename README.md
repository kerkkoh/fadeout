Fade Out
=========================

Fade Out is an online script writer with some simple styling possibilities.

It saves your writing into local storage whenever you write anything.

Why you ask?

Because I thought there aren't enough script editors online and also because it's cool, and there isn't enough stuff written in `Courier New` on the internet.
